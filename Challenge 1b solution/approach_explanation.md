# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a sophisticated multi-stage document intelligence pipeline that combines semantic analysis, persona-specific ranking, and contextual relevance scoring to extract the most pertinent information from document collections.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Utilizes PyMuPDF for efficient text and structure extraction while preserving document hierarchy
- **Semantic Chunking**: Implements sliding window segmentation with overlap to maintain context continuity
- **Section Detection**: Employs regex patterns and structural analysis to identify document sections and subsections

### 2. Persona-Aware Similarity Engine
- **Multi-Vector Embedding**: Combines sentence-transformers with TF-IDF for hybrid semantic-statistical analysis
- **Persona Contextualization**: Creates dynamic persona profiles by analyzing role-specific keywords and domain expertise
- **Job Alignment Scoring**: Implements cosine similarity with persona-weighted feature vectors

### 3. Intelligent Ranking System
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-criteria evaluation considering semantic similarity, keyword density, and section importance
- **Contextual Weighting**: Adjusts scores based on document type, section hierarchy, and content density
- **Diversity Optimization**: Ensures varied coverage across different aspects of the job requirements

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamic relevance cutoffs based on collection quality and persona specificity
- **Cross-Document Coherence**: Maintains thematic consistency across selected sections
- **Computational Efficiency**: Optimized for CPU-only execution with model size constraints

## Technical Implementation

The system leverages lightweight yet powerful models including DistilBERT for embeddings and advanced similarity metrics like Jaccard coefficient and semantic distance measures. The pipeline processes documents in parallel while maintaining memory efficiency through strategic caching and batch processing.

## Performance Characteristics

- Processing time: <60 seconds for 3-5 documents
- Model footprint: <1GB total
- Accuracy: High precision in persona-job alignment through multi-stage validation
- Scalability: Handles diverse domains from academic research to business analysis

This approach ensures robust performance across varied document types, personas, and job requirements while maintaining computational efficiency and accuracy.
